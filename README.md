STCM2 files disassembled with the `-j`/`--junk` flag should assemble identically to the original file.
Please raise an issue with the name of the game, console, and language if this is not the case.

Files in `asms` and `reasms` are ad-hoc scripts for my own use; I put them here because I'm lazy. Feel free to use/modify them, but no support will be provided.

## Known compatible games
- Edel Blume (PS2, Japan) (except for one script with no dialogue info)
- ROOTâˆžREXX (Vita, Japan)
- AMNESIA World (Switch, Japan)
- Cendrillon palikA (Switch, Japan)
